# Privacy Policy

The app is usable anonymously for getting info, but if you want to star repos, you need to login with Github. Just hit the button in the app and youll be redirected to Oauth Github for login.

The only things we use your Github permissions for are:
- starring/unstarring a repo
- checking if a repo is already starred or not
